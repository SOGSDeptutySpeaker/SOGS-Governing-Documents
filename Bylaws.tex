\section{Conflict of Interest}
\index{Conflict of Interest|(}
\begin{longenum}[ label*=\thesection.\arabic*., align=left]
	\item A conflict of interest arises when any current member of Council, the Society's Executive or Non-Executive officers, committee member, or other elected or appointed position of the Society has or could be seen to have the opportunity to use the authority, knowledge or influence derived from one's position in order to provide personal or financial gain to the individual in question, or a member of the individual's family, or else an agency with which the individual is employed. The following instances could be  considered conflicts of interest, though conflicts are not limited to these instances: 
    \index{Conflict of Interest!Definition}
    %\begin{longenum}[ label*=\arabic*., align=left]
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item One is involved in both the solicitation of, and rendering of services or products to the Society, and for  which discretionary authority may be exercised at any stage  of the commissioning of said services or products.
        \item One is involved in either the solicitation or rendering of services or products to the Society wherein one stands to make personal financial gains, for instance as a shareholder, contract employee, or investor.
        \item One is participating in the hiring, contract review, or investigation of an immediate relative, spouse, in-law, step-child, or third-party business partner for the Society. 
        \item One places or has placed the needs or demands of a third party or agency above the stated or acknowledged needs of the Society. 
        \item One is involved as an adjudicator in any of the Society's adjudication processes wherein one is also an appellant, complainant or defendant, or in which one has provided material evidence.
        \item An Executive or Non-Executive Officer participates outside of an administrative role in a draw, lottery or similar event organized by the Society or its affiliated businesses (ex. the Grad Club). The same applies to TA Awards, Western Research Forum, all bursary or grant programmes, and similar matters run by the Society. Other instances of Conflict of Interest not listed above, but which are consistent with the spirit of the law, may be considered on an ad hoc basis provided they meet the minimum standard of demonstrable personal or financial benefit to the individual or a member of the individual's family,  or else an agency with which the individual is employed.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{longenum}[ label*=\arabic*., align=left]
	\item Matters of common interest, referring to instances in which any member of SOGS may have equal opportunity to  benefit from an arrangement of any type, are as a general  rule not considered a Conflict of Interest. That is to say, the interest must be specific to an identifiable individual or exclusive small group (business partnership, family, and the like). 
    \index{Conflict of Interest!Common Interest}
	\end{longenum}
    \item In all instances above, a member of the Society who perceives him- or herself to be in a Conflict of Interest, may do the following to extricate themselves from the conflict:
    \begin{longenum}[ label*=\arabic*., align=left]
		\item Declare one's conflict, and
        \begin{longenum}[ label*=\arabic*., align=left]
			\item Recuse oneself from all participation, including administrative, in the activity in which one deems oneself to be in conflict, or
            \item If the conflict of interest is such that one can no longer discharge his/her duties to the Society, one may resign from one's position of authority or influence, provided doing so resolves the conflict in question.
		\end{longenum}
        \item Pursuant to adopting any of the actions therein but only after the fact does not resolve the conflict, and may still result in sanctions or censure (see Bylaw 11.3 below).
	\end{longenum}
    \item The procedure for resolving any perceived and either undeclared or unresolved Conflict of Interest is governed by the Conflict of Interest Resolution Policy Document, located in the SOGS office and on the SOGS website.

\item Activities considered to be harassment or discrimination may include, but are not limited to, adverse treatment, inappropriate gestures, remarks intended to intimidate or degrade, and exclusion based on discriminatory grounds.



\item The preference of the Society is to seek an informal resolution where ever possible. This may consist in direct discussion between the parties or, failing this, the parties may request the Ombudsperson to act as an informal mediator. (If the Ombudsperson cannot act as the mediator, a request may be made to the Speaker to act in their stead.)
